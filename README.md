### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vjola!

I am a full stack engineer proficient in languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and frameworks including React, Redux, Flask and Express. I am passionate about delivering elegant, user-intuitive products that address real needs. Coming from a biomedical research background, programming has now become my primary outlet for my persistent curiosity, problem-solving skills and creative expression!
